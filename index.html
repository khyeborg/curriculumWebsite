They are going to take this time to compare and contrast the information they have gathered in order to draw a conclusion about the spread in other places compared to their own neighborhood. Some students may conclude that the spread in the neighborhood of choice is similar to the spread in their own neighborhood. Some might choose to want to move to the neighborhood they choose to study. And some students will realize that their neighborhood might just be in better standings than most.</p>

				<p class="math_p">The students wrap up their study of the COVID 19 spread with their neighborhood but reflecting on a list of questions. They will first have time to reflect individually and think about what has changed in their lives and how they feel about the spread. They will then create 3 questions of their own to be able to interview a peer. As a pair/group the students will then come up with next steps or predictions about what they believe will happen in NY in the next couple of weeks? Months? Season?</p>

				<h1 class="title">Overview</h1>

				<h2 class="computer_science_h2">Introduction</h2>
				<p class="computer_science_p">Welcome to the Computer Science section of the “Understanding the Pandemic” curriculum! In the Computer Science section, students will engage in hands-on coding projects using the p5 Coding Library to build simulations to visualize the spread of COVID-19. The Computer Science section of the curriculum aims to instill awareness about the mechanics of the spread of COVID-19 using culturally sustaining pedagogy and authentic assessments. Through the simulations and coding projects, students will better understand the underlying mechanics of COVID-19 from an analytical perspective to better protect themselves, each other, and their families.</p>

				<h2 class="computer_science_h2">Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy</h2>
				<p class="computer_science_p">In the Day 7: Virus Variables Input section, students will make use of the COVID Alert NY app and other reliable COVID-19 data sources to gain accurate data to run disease spread simulations that reflect the difference in spread in neighborhoods of different demographics, especially contrasting the difference in spread, recovery, and mortality rates between predominantly white neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods. Students are asked to collect data of the demographics distribution in different cities, select a predominantly white neighborhood and a minority neighborhood, and collect COVID-19 data in the cities selected. Students will use the data collected to run two simulations and record their observations to be used in further discussions centered on reasons for the difference in spread and mortality.</p>

				<h2 class="computer_science_h2">Authentic Assessment</h2>
				<p class="computer_science_p">In the assessment section, students will use the existing code as the foundation and implement additional features to enhance the COVID-19 simulation to better reflect the real time spread of COVID-19. Students are introduced to the assessment and guided to formulate additional features to be added to the existing simulation to better reflect the real time spread of COVID-19. Students are encouraged to tackle the assessment from any aspects of the virus, based on their field of interests. Two sample projects with downloadable source code can be found to introduce students to some possible ways of enhancing the simulation.</p>
